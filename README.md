## 🚀 About DarkNodeAI
DarkNodeAI is a personal hub for **AI-driven cybersecurity research and development**.  
I explore the intersection of **machine learning, large language models, and ethical hacking** to create tools, scripts, and workflows that push the boundaries of what's possible — responsibly.

## 💡 Mission
To build, test, and refine **AI-assisted security tools** that help penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, and researchers work smarter and faster — while maintaining **ethical guidelines** and **legal compliance**.

## 🛠 Areas of Focus
- 🤖 **Large Language Models (LLMs)** — Fine-tuning and deploying AI models like WhiteRabbitNeo, LLaMA, and Mistral.
- 🛡 **Red & Blue Team Tools** — Automation for vulnerability scanning, recon, and threat detection.
- 📊 **OSINT Automation** — AI-driven workflows to gather and analyze open-source intelligence.
- ⚙️ **Custom API Deployments** — Making AI tools accessible through fast, scalable web endpoints.

## 📂 Featured Projects
- **WhiteRabbitNeo Server** — Host the WhiteRabbitNeo-13B-v1 model locally or on the cloud with an API interface.
- **DarkNode Toolkit** — Scripts and utilities for AI-assisted recon and security automation.
- **OSINT-AI** — An AI-powered dashboard for intelligence gathering.
